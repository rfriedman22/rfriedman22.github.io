		I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/compbio/Pages/default.aspx">Computational and Systems Biology</a> program at <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I work in <a href="http://genetics.wustl.edu/bclab/">Barak Cohen's lab</a> in the <a href="https://genomesciences.wustl.edu/">Edison Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology</a>, and the <a href="https://genetics.wustl.edu">Department of Genetics</a>.

		My thesis research is focused on understanding how <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences (such as enhancers and silencers) encode gene expression levels, using mammalian photoreceptors as a model system. My work uses a combination of large-scale experiments, machine learning, and systems biology.

		I believe that science should be accessible and welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, nationality, immigration status, religion, ability, socioeconomic status, and beyond. We all have an obligation to dismantle structures of power that prevent people from succeeding.

		In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading, playing video games, watching TV, and listening to emo and punk music.
