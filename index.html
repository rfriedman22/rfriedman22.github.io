		I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in <a href="https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/">Cole Trapnell's lab</a> 
		at the University of Washington <a href="https://www.gs.washington.edu/">Department of Genome Sciences</a>. 
		I got my Ph.D. in <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/compbio/Pages/default.aspx">Computational and Systems Biology</a> 
		from Washington University in St. Louis. I was co-advised by <a href="http://genetics.wustl.edu/bclab/">Barak Cohen</a> 
		and <a href="http://genetics.wustl.edu/mwhite/">Mike A. White</a> in the 
		<a href="https://genomesciences.wustl.edu/">Edison Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology</a>, 
		and the <a href="https://genetics.wustl.edu">Department of Genetics</a>.

		I am interested in understanding how the instructions for multicellular life is programmed 
		into a single genome. I use techniques from machine learning, active learning, systems 
		biology, and data visualization to interpret sequencing data generated from high-throughput 
		perturbation experiments. In my postdoc, I am developing new computational methods that 
		infer gene regulatory networks to reveal mechanisms underlying zebrafish development. 
		During my Ph.D., I created an active machine learning framework to model <i>cis</i>-regulatory 
		grammar by continuously generating data through Massively Parallel Reporter Assays.

		I believe that science should be accessible and welcoming to all people regardless of race, 
		ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, nationality, immigration status, religion, ability, 
		socioeconomic status, and beyond. We all have an obligation to dismantle structures of power 
		that prevent people from succeeding.

		In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading, live music, hiking, paddleboarding, playing video games, and spending time with friends.
