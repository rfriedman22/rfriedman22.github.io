I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computational and Systems Biology](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/compbio/Pages/default.aspx) program at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I work in [Barak Cohen's lab](http://genetics.wustl.edu/bclab/) in the [Edison Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology](https://genomesciences.wustl.edu/), and the [Department of Genetics](https://genetics.wustl.edu).

My thesis research is focused on understanding how *cis*-regulatory sequences (such as enhancers and silencers) encode gene expression levels, using mammalian photoreceptors as a model system. My work uses a combination of large-scale experiments, machine learning, and systems biology.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading, playing video games, watching TV, and listening to emo and punk music.
